const edCareer = "My first career was in private international education. I was a teacher, administrator, and finally consultant in Korea, Nepal, Myanmar, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam. I taught advanced history at international schools and developed academic programs. I wrote curricula, worked with accrediting organizations, hired, trained, and evaluated staff, and aided with general policy. It was an enjoyable and rewarding career."

const softwareCareer = "In 2014 I transitioned from education to software. I initially worked as an independent freelancer. In 2016 a furniture factory hired me as a full time software engineer. I created a B2B catalogue and a number of administrative tools to aid operations."

const apple = "In 2018 I moved back to the US and took a contract position as a Software Engineer at Apple. When I arrived, there was a small proof of concept. When I left, we had a successful app in production with a large user base. I led the React development and the front end architecture. I also mentored junior developers new to web development. It was a very successful project. I've since continued as a full stack engineer."
